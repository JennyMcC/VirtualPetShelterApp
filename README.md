# Virtual Pet Shelter

I have four animals that will all eat, drink and play.
At the end of the loot the user can either look at the status of all the pets, 
or look at one individual pets status by typing its name. 
The user may also quit if they type quit.
Adopting and admitting a pet proved more challenging, 
I've commented out the last of 1,000 things I tried that didn't work.
Other than that, they game will end if any of the pets starve to death or if the shelter is empty.
